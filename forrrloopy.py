# question generating a 3*3 matrix with  9 random prime numbers using a for loop in python


# In[13]:


#a 3 by 3 matrix is a matrix that has 3 rows and 3 columns 

[1,1,2],
[2,3,4],
[5,6,7],


#a prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 eg:1,2,3,5,7,11
[1,5,7,1],
[3,11,13,17],
[2,5,7,3]

#hint you need to learn numpy to do this
#if you can do it w/o numpy lmk


# In[12]:


list1=[1,3,5,7]
list2=[1,3,5,7]
prime=[i/j for i,j in zip(list1,list2)]
print (prime)
